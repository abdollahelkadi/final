Project Plan for Blog Website Worker

1. Add Comments Feature
   - Implement endpoints for users to post, view, and delete comments on articles.
   - Store comments in a new database table (e.g., 'comments') with fields: id, article_id, author, content, created_at.
   - Add moderation options for admin (approve/delete).

2. Add Likes Feature
   - Implement endpoints to allow users to like articles.
   - Store likes in a new table (e.g., 'likes') with fields: id, article_id, user_id, created_at.
   - Prevent multiple likes from the same user (use IP or user identifier).

3. Worker Limits & Security
   - Add rate limiting middleware to restrict requests per IP/user (e.g., max 100 requests/hour).
   - Add request timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) to prevent abuse.
   - Log suspicious activity and block repeated offenders.
   - Consider using CAPTCHA for sensitive actions.

4. Add Pages (Contact, About, etc.)
   - Create endpoints to serve static content for pages like /about, /contact, /privacy, /terms.
   - Store page content in the database or as static files.

5. Link Social Media
   - Add fields in the site config for social media URLs (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram).
   - Display social media links in the footer and about page.
   - Optionally, add Open Graph tags for better sharing.

6. Write a Lot of Articles
   - Populate the database with many sample articles covering various topics.
   - Use scripts or admin endpoints to bulk import articles.
   - Ensure articles have proper tags, summaries, and images.

7. Additional Recommendations
   - Use strong admin passwords and rotate regularly.
   - Implement logging and monitoring for worker health.
   - Add SEO enhancements (structured data, meta tags).
   - Regularly backup the database.

End of Plan.
